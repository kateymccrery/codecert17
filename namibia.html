  <h1>Hallo!</h1>
  <h2>
    I just told you hello in Afrikaans, which is a language spoken in Namibia due to the colonial forces that took over Namibia from the native tribes throughout the country's histroy. German colonialists were also part of those forces.

      Namibia seems like an amazing place in terms of food, geography, and cultural way of life.
      <ul>
        <li>Outdoor cooking is part of the Namibian way of life. The traditional braaivleis (meat barbeque) is a tasty meal, as is potjiekos, a spicy stew of meat, chicken and fish cooked in a cast iron, three-legged pot over an open fire.

        </li>
        <br/>
        <li>Namibia is one of the places where the ocean meets the desert. This is the landscape referenced above, and is on my bucket list of places to see before I die. The Namib Desert is a coastal desert, which you can find more about
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namib">here.</a>
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li>The capital of Namibia is Windhoek, which is roughly about the size of New Orleans at 325,858 in 2011. Click here <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windhoek"> to find out more about the capital.</a>
